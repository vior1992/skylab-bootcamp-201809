                    EnetPoker, Arona (Spain)
                    In this company, I participated in a long-term project in which was developed an API to manage a
                    gaming integral platform and a poker software client.
                    At the same time, our API was interconnected with other external companies which was online games
                    providers, so that we offered our clients
                    not only the poker software developed by us but also software developed by third parties. This
                    allowed
                    us to save developing time.
                    My work consisted in to develop new requeriments for this API and to interconnect our system with
                    other external systems using web services or REST API.
                    I also worked with data bases (sql server 2012) developing store procedures, queries, functions,
                    triggers, etc...
                    At the same time, I offered support to web department in both PHP and javascript(jquery, angularJS)
                    technologies

                    Conectatec, Arona (Spain)
                    In this company I used PHP as back-end language. In this company I developed in one year two main
                    project: one of them was done in PHP using CakePHP framework and another one was done in .Net,
                    but this last was not a web project else a windows form project. This was installed in a terminal
                    which
                    had a touch screen in order to offer customer services in the hotels where this was deployed.

                    In this company I worked as seller of network products (switches, routers, wifi products, etc...)
                    as
                    well
                    as .Net programmer. My main task was to develop desktop applications for internal use of the
                    company.

                    Mnemo Evolution Integration Services, S.A, Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Spain)
                    In this company I was working in a CAU (user center support). My main task was to find bugs and
                    solve them.
                    When an public administration found a bug in the software that they used, a incidence was opened
                    and tracked.
                    This job I didn´t like so much because the software was not well documented and it had been done in
                    VB6 so that it was very difficult to find error.

        <h2><i><u>Communication Skills:</u></i></h2>
        <p>have gained good communication skills from my last work experience.
            I have had to work with people from a lot different countries and this situacion has helped me to
            improve my english and to be much more flexible when two persons are sharing ideas to solve a
            problem.
            I love work in team and to share knowledge with other partners</p>
        <h2><i><u>Organisational / managerial skills:</u></i></h2>
        <p> love the clean code, well documented and organized.
            I love use frameworks or to learn new ones because its a way to program in a better organized way
            and the programmer has a lot of work done.
            For me, its very important that the requisites of a project are well defined at the begining of a
            project
            because it can suppose the success or the failure of a project.</p>
